Introducing Online Railway Reservation System Technology has transformed many aspects of life in the 21st century, including the way many<br> of us make train reservations. For example, to make ticketing more convenient for travelers,We have started an online <br>reservation system, which helps us in booking tickets from the comfort of our homes or offices. While this is convenient for most people, it has<br> made things particularly easier for people residing in remote locations. The system is basically concerned with the reservation and cancellation<br> of railways tickets of the passenger. The need of this system arose because as is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the<br> whole of the world and to handle it manually is quite a tough job. By computerizing it, we will be able to overcome many of its limitations and will<br> be able to make it more efficient. The handling of data and records for such a vast system is a very complex task if done manually but it can be<br> made easier if the system is computerized. 
 The Customers are required to register on the server for getting Access to the database and query result <br>retrieval. Upon registration, each user has an account which is essentially the ‘view level’ for the customer. The account contains comprehensive<br> information of the user entered during registration and permits the customer to get access to his past reservations, enquire about travel fare and<br> availability of seats, make afresh reservations, update his account details, etc. Abstract Railway Reservation System is a complex online distributed <br>transaction application based on client server architecture. The salient features of the software include allowing user from anywhere to do a booking<br> for a journey in any train in any class from anywhere to anywhere; handling reservation, modifications cancellation/refunds.<br><br>
